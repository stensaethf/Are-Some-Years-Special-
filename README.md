# Special Years
An investigation into whether some years are more special than others.

An old friend of mine inspired me to look into whether a pattern existed for how many divisors a year (number) has, so I wrote a small program.

Interestingly enough, up to 100,000 the maximum number of primes is 8. And the first occurance of that is in 30,030.

The relationship between primes and divisors appear to be positive, although mostly for the first 30,000.

As for evens and odds, both display a positive relationship. The higher the number, the higher amount of divisors. The relationship is much stronger for evens than for odds.

Triangular numbers showcase another interesting relationship. Sure the trend is overall positive, but there are significant ups and downs, meaning that the trend is not steadily increasing, but rather going up and down with the overall result being positive.

Usage:
$ python specialYears.py \<normal | primes | compare | even | odd | triangular\> \<start year\> \<end year\>
