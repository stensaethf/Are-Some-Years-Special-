# Special Years
An investigation into whether some years are more special than others.

An old friend of mine inspired me to look into whether a pattern existed for how many divisors a year (number) has, so I wrote a small program.

Usage:
$ python specialYears.py \<normal | dynamic \> \<start year\> 
<end year
> ...

Note: the dynamic option has not been implemented yet.

More to come!
