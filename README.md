# Special Years
An investigation into whether some years are more special than others.

An old friend of mine inspired me to look into whether a pattern existed for how many divisors a year (number) has, so I wrote a small program.

Interestingly enough, up to 100,000 the maximum number of primes is 8. And the first occurance of that is in 30030.

The relationship between primes and divisors appear to be positive, although mostly for the first 30,000.

Usage:
$ python specialYears.py \<normal | primes | compare \> \<start year\> \<end year\>

More to come!
